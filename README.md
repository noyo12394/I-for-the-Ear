# I-for-the-Ear

A YOLOv8-based model for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) detection and recognition. This project leverages deep learning to accurately identify ASL hand gestures, aimed at improving communication accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.

## Features
- **Real-Time ASL Detection:** Recognizes and translates ASL gestures on-the-fly.
- **YOLOv8 Architecture:** Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection for improved accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/noyo12394/I-for-the-Ear.git
    cd I-for-the-Ear
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the YOLOv8 model weights and dataset (add links or instructions if needed).

## Usage

Run the script to start detecting ASL gestures:
```bash
python detect.py --source <path_to_video_or_camera> --weights yolov8n.pt
```

For live webcam detection:
```bash
python detect.py --source 0 --weights yolov8n.pt
```

## Dataset

The model is trained on an American Sign Language dataset containing labeled images of various hand gestures. You can modify or expand the dataset by placing new images in the `dataset` folder and updating the configuration files accordingly.

## Model Training

To train the YOLOv8 model on your dataset:
```bash
python train.py --data data.yaml --epochs 50 --weights yolov8n.pt
```

Adjust the parameters such as `epochs` and `batch-size` based on your system's capabilities.

## Results

After training, the model achieved high accuracy in detecting common ASL gestures in real-time. Example outputs can be found in the `results` folder.
